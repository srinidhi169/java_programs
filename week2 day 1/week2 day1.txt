Oporetors:
Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations
*combination of operends and operator is called a expression.
*based on how many operands that an operator will accecpt we have 3 types
they are:1.unary operator 
	 2.binary operator 
	 3.ternary operator
based on the opretions that the operator will perform we have
types are:
	1.Arithmetic Operators
	2.Assignment Operator
	3.Relational Operators
	4.Logical Operators
	5.Ternary Operator
	6.Bitwise Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators: They are used to perform simple arithmetic operations on primitive data types. 

* : Multiplication
/ : Division
% : Modules 
+ : Addition
– : Subtraction

2.Assignment Operator: ‘=’ Assignment operator is used to assigning a value to any variable.
3.Relational Operators: These operators are used to check for relations like equality, greater than, and less than.
	*the result is in the boolean value(true/false)
	==,!=,<,>,<=,>=
4.Logical Operators: These operators are used to perform logical operetions.
	1.&&, Logical AND: returns true when both conditions are true.
	2.||, Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true.
	3.!, Logical NOT: returns true when a condition is false and vice-versa	

5.Ternary operator: Ternary operator if the condition is true then first statement is printed else 2nd stement is printed
	condition ? if true : if false
6. Bitwise Operators: These operators are used to alter the individual bits of a number. 
	1.&, Bitwise AND operator: returns bit by bit AND of input values.
	2.|, Bitwise OR operator: returns bit by bit OR of input values.
	3.^, Bitwise XOR operator: returns bit-by-bit XOR of input values.
	4.~, Bitwise Complement Operator: This is a unary operator which returns the one’s complement
